##  **Features & Improvements** 

-  **Force Touch Drag and Drop on iOS** ✌️

	You ask. We listen. The iOS beta now supports drag and drop! Press and hold or force-touch to drag a block. **Upgrade in your TestFlight to get the new version. ** We put a lot of love into this one. Let us know what you think! 

	Also, Message us your Apple ID and we'll add you to the iOS beta list. (In the left sidebar of your browser or desktop app hit Help & Feedback -> Message Us.)

-  **Trash Can** 

	Now, when you delete top-level pages, they go into Trash, where you can easily restore them, or delete them permanently.

	![](https://static.notion-static.com/13308ad8cb784eddb642cc8749f04e36/trash_can.gif)

-  **A simpler, shared sidebar for your team!** 

	For this release, we gathered all our feedback about the sidebar, and came up with a much simpler design.

	For teams, there are now three sections: **Favorites** , **Team Pages** , and **My Pages** . Team pages stay in sync across your team, so there's no need to manually join pages you couldn't see!

	For personal, there are three sections: **Favorites** , **My Pages** , and **Shared With Me** .

	![](https://static.notion-static.com/0e3c43b166b84ad4ab86ede20d00b763/sidebar_collapse.gif)

-  **Revamped Keyboard Shortcuts!** 

	We spent a lot of time going over our keyboard shortcuts. We simplified some of our shortcuts, and added a lot of new ones! Some highlights:

	-  `Enter` always inserts text, just like your favorite old-school text editor.
	-  `Command/Ctrl + Enter` to navigate to pages, check to-dos, open toggles, and upload files and images.
	-  `Command/Ctrl + Option + S` to toggle the Sidebar open and closed.
	-  `Command/Ctrl + K` or `Command/Ctrl + P` to open quick find.
	-  `Command/Ctrl + Shift + L ` to add an inline text link.
	-  `Space` on images to go full screen.
	- Type three dashes ( `-` ) to create a divider.
	- Type three back-ticks ( ``` ) to create a code block.
	-  `Command/Ctrl + Option + M` to comment.

##  **Bug Fixes** 

-  ****Hitting enter at the beginning of a header now moves the header down**** 

	This one was annoying some of you guys.

-  **Uploads complete even if you navigate away** 

	Before, uploads would fail if you navigated away from the page.

-  **Better image preview during upload** 

	Before, if you move an image that's being uploaded, the preview could disappear

-  **Tab multiple lines in a code block** 😱

	Rejoice! You can now tab multiple lines in code blocks!

-  ****@Mentions, numbered lists, and equations in markdown export**** 

	Before, mentions, numbered lists, and equations did not export properly to markdown.

-  **Less annoying auto-linker** 

	Our previous auto-linker sometimes made it impossible to remove the link that was created automatically.

-  **Support for the shift+end shortcut** 

	Shout out to our hardcore keyboard people 🤓

-  **Fixed bugs with inline code and bold** 

	We found a few bugs that sometimes caused inline code and bold to break.

-  ****Embed SVGs**** 

	Previously, embedding SVGs did not work 😤

-  **Clicking external links in the desktop app** 

	Sometimes, external links would open in a new window instead of opening in your web browser.

-  **Fixed Invision embeds** 

	Before, Invision embeds didn't always work.

-  ****Scrollbars on Linux and Windows**** 

	We fixed some annoying horizontal scrollbars on these platforms.

-  **... and a lot more. We literally fixed 100+ bugs in this release** 🙅‍♂️🙅🐞🕷

# Jun 28th, 2017

##  **Features & Improvements**

-  **Embed everything! 🐙** 

	Notion now supports many more embed types. Embed a live Framer or Invision prototype, a Tweet, or even a working Google Sheet or Google Doc. Try it!

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/c5a6b3bb556e4d22b001db403db31cf7/Embeds02.png)

-  **Embed and media resizing** 

	For many embed and media types, you can now resize and change the aspect ratio. This is really handy if you are trying to embed a prototype from Framer or Invision, or make your Google Sheet larger.

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/80994621fcae4c7f81ee42a736576eb7/notion-framer-embed.gif)

-  **Share to your Google Contacts** 

	You can now invite any of your Google contacts to your page or team – no need to copy and paste their emails anymore!

	(You have to log out and log back in for this to work 👈)

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/78214ab8794b4c7897e1d70dea40e603/Screen_Shot_2017-06-28_at_13.07.12.png)

-  **Code block copy text** 

	You can now copy an entire code block with one click. This will be extra useful for frequently used code snippets.

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/f7f2d1c8f4cd4c0bbf53832a68b37169/codeblock-copy-to-clipboard.png)

-  **Save scroll position when navigating 📜** 

	When navigating back to the previous page, Notion will restore your scroll position.

-  **Better offline indicator** 

	We now have a more prominent offline indicator. When you hover over it, you can see how many offline edits have yet to be synced. Also when the app is syncing, we provide a progress indicator.

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/23eb326a08b6475f89b438a37b523635/Untitled)

##  **Bug Fixes** 

-  **Quick Find scrolling to block** 

	Previously, when searching for a block, Notion could only scroll to blocks that were above the fold. Now it loads as much of the page as needed.

-  **ChromeOS S-key** 

	We fixed a bug where the `s` key didn't work on ChromeOS.

-  **Inline code weirdness** 

	Some weird things used to happen when pasting emojis into an inline code block.

-  **Download the desktop app in Firefox** 

	We handled a browser quirk where Firefox would redirect away from the download page.

-  **... and so many other small bugs here and there 🕵️** 

---

# Jun 6th, 2017

##  **Features & Improvements** 

-  **Quick Find ⚡️** 

	Quickly jump to pages and blocks without lifting your fingers from your keyboard! Just hit `Command/Ctrl + /` (or `Command/Ctrl + P` ), type the name of the page or block, hit enter, and Notion will take you right there!

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/edc506e7350e4b91a297d4fdfd2fcefd/quick-find.gif)

-  **Revamped Search** **🔍** 

	We completely revamped our search algorithm. It's now faster with way more accurate results.

	It's still a work in progress, so message us in the app if you couldn't find what you were looking for, and we can tweak the algorithm.

-  **New Team & Personal Welcome Page 👋** 

	We updated our welcome page to be prettier and more inviting. It will now show your team's icon as well.

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/8b3cb6a4ba464e338713f05582728eaf/Screen_Shot_2017-06-06_at_16.07.50.png)

##  **Bug Fixes** 

-  **Emoji in the Mac app** 

	Sometimes typing emojis in the Mac app would cause weird characters to appear.

-  **Creating a new page offline** 

	We fixed a bug where creating a new page in the Mac app when offline didn't work.

-  **Duplicate spaces in your sidebar** 

	Previously, it was possible in some cases to see a duplicate space.

-  **Undo in discussions** 

	Before, you could undo inside of a discussion. Pretty cool, but not exactly what you would expect 😂

-  **Drag and drop images into a block** 

	Sometimes, you couldn't drag an image from your desktop directly below the currently selected block.

---

# May 15th, 2017

##  **Features & Improvements** 

-  **Better comments! 💬 👌** 

	We made comments a lot friendlier. You don't need to click to read what's inside. Check it out!

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/b893c56ff3134f8facdfbaa115dbb9d4/comments_3.gif)

##  **Bug Fixes** 

-  **Select text with shift + arrow** 

	Before, sometimes you couldn't select multiple text blocks with the keyboard.

-  **Comment confirmation dialog** 

	Before, if you closed a comment popup, you could lose the content. Now, we prompt you with a confirmation dialog.

-  **Broken desktop app download link 😓** 

	Some old links for downloading the desktop app were broken. These are now fixed.

-  **Public pages always added to your sidebar** 

	Before, public pages (like this What's New page) were always added to your sidebar.

-  **Enter key on mobile 📲** 

	The enter key didn't behave as expected on mobile browsers.

-  **Member count in the sidebar ** 

	Previously, the number next to your "Settings & Members" in your sidebar included guests. This was confusing as guests are free-of-charge.

---

# May 3, 2017

##  **Features & Improvements** 

-  **Revamped Slack notifications: less noisy, and more personal 🙂** 

	Many of you suggested that our Slack notifications were too noisy, so we did a complete makeover. It now truncates lengthy updates, also shows the page emoji as well as the avatar of the editor. Try it!

	You can enable the Slack notification near the top right of your window -> then click Add to Slack.

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/b44a8e1d7a7b4e62a0d53762d897a4cf/new-slack-notifications.gif)

-  **Page icon as browser tab favicon** 

	We now set the browser tab favicon based on your page icon – it'll be a huge time-saver for those of you have many browser tabs open at once.

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/d8cf5aca26c746189a2c4eaa067bd665/emoji_in_title.gif)

-  **Ctrl/Cmd + A to select all** 

	Now if you press Ctrl/Cmd + A twice, it would select everything on your page.

-  **An easier way to configure a template button** 

	We added a special button for configuring the template button block. Not need to right-click again!

	![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/d2a4e78c64ce49b6a5bfe8946bd4e24a/Untitled)

##  **Bug Fixes** 

-  **Mobile search** 

	The mobile search experience was buggy, so we polished it up.

-  **Turn a toggle into a header** 

	Before, if you turned a toggle list into a header or sub header, the blocks inside would be inverted.

-  **Double emoji page icons 👯** 

	Before, for the page icon, certain emojis showed up as two emojis.

-  **Mac app: use template picker while offline** 

	Now, we let you start with an empty page and bypass the template picker.

-  **Mac app: visit a team pages while offline** 

	If you visited a team page while offline, the page could be accidentally bookmarked in your personal space.

-  **Billing description re: guests** 

	Before, the billing page included guests in the invoice (guests should be free and not counted towards your monthly bill).

-  **Reorder in the left sidebar** 

	If you reordered items in your left sidebar, it revealed unnecessary buttons.

-  **... and many small bugs here and there 🐸**

-  **April 28th, 2017** 

	##  **Bug Fixes** 

	-  **Mac App: OS copy & paste 😅**

---

-  **April 24th, 2017** 

	##  **Features & Improvements**

-  **April 17th, 2017** 

	##  **Features & Improvements** 

	-  **Mac App: spell check 🔤 👌** 

		The long-waited spell checker is finally here. You should receive a prompt in your Mac app to download the latest version. Say goodbye to all those typos...

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/1d3dcd7304ff405ea23123c7e851c767/Feature_-_Mac_Spellcheck.gif)

	-  **Mac App: multi-window support ** 

		You can finally have multiple Notion windows open at the same time!
		Pro-tip: use `Command + `` to toggle between different windows. (It's the little key on the left of "1").

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/7f6747c4507d44d1bfddb5baeb69ef8b/Untitled)

	-  **Mac app: 3-finger swipe to navigate history 🖖** 

		If are you used to the 3-finger swipe in your browser, you can also do it with your Notion Mac app. (To enable it, go to System Preferences -> Trackpad -> and set "Swipe between pages" to "three fingers").

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/b2af319ef0604914a170a2556ad4684f/Screen_Shot_2017-04-18_at_8.09.26_AM.jpg)

	-  **Mac app: speedup 🚗 🏁** 

		Last but not least, there's a noticeable speed improvement with the Mac app. (Nerd talk: we updated to the latest Electron 🤓)

	##  **Bug Fixes** 

	-  **Slash commands** 

		Slash commands was broken on some of the old content after the last release.

	-  **Pasting blocks out of order ** 🤦‍♂️

		Sometimes pasting blocks could cause them to be inserted in the wrong order.

	-  **Search returning deleted content** 

		Search could sometimes return content that was deleted.

---

-  **April 15th, 2017 – Notion 1.7** 

	##  **Features & Improvements** 

	-  **3X speedup ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️** 

		We locked ourselves in for the past couple months and pretty much rewrote Notion from scratch. Now, all of your pages will load much faster. We worked really, really hard on this and hopefully it will put a smile on your face 🤗 

	-  **Page covers and styles** 

		You can now add a beautiful image to the top of any page. We also hand-picked nearly a hundred images from the The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Rijksmuseum, and NASA archive for you to choose from. Page styles have been simplified as well.

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/9a268aaaf3e0461391ec83e9cc9416cc/covers4.gif)

	-  **A much, much faster drag & drop** 

		The old drag & drop required some serious dexterity. Try the new one – it's fast and much more accurate.

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/2a6c2458d065445ea90e26b9d578fb42/todo4.gif)

	-  **A brand new sidebar for your team** 

		The old sidebar could be confusing. We redesigned it (and borrowed a couple ideas from Slack). For teams, it now separates your team and private pages, and lets you discover your teammates' pages with just a click.

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/b4dba1dc529c471e95946877190d3ed5/Screen_Shot_2017-04-15_at_4.32.jpg)

	-  **Page emojis and icons** 

		You can now customize any page's icon with an image or emoji – to add some color for your content, and help you find the page in the sidebar.

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/7df9b51f30bb4e5a8e6d464b57fa32bc/emoji_portrait.gif)

	-  **Quickly add a new page 🏃🏃‍♀️** 

		When you hover over the left sidebar, you'll see a "+" button next to every page. It lets you quickly create a new page inside, without polluting your entire team's top-level pages. 

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/b451ad76966149ef9fe6689fb00caaee/Frame.png)

	-  **More templates!** 

		We added Weekly Planner, Team Home, and Travel Notes templates.
		We also made the template picker less obtrusive. It only shows up when the page is empty, and you can always hit "Enter" to quickly start with an empty page.

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/32a4ca48715b4f1090979e3314a884a0/template.gif)

	-  **Basic page analytics 📈** 

		You can now see recent edits and viewers of any page.

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/9d7be746f69e47fa8540253554bf3ee1/Frame.png)

	-  **RIP Sections. Long live Headers! 🙌** 

		In the old Notion, it was hard to know which Section you were inside of. Sections are now Headers and Sub-headers. They work nicely with the # and ## Markdown shortcuts. Don't worry, you can still use "Turn Into" to transform Pages into Headers.

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/427cf935c3e842d1a71389ed2cf3564b/subheaders.gif)

	-  **Quote block** 
	-  **Include id in Invoice PDF titles** 
	-  **Simplified guest and pricing model for teams** 

		You can now add as many guests to your team as you like – for free. You'll also be charged for all members on your team at the end of the every billing cycle, whether they have been active in the previous month or not – it's easier to budget, but could potentially result in a larger bill – so watch out!

	-  **P.S. A much better mobile version!** 

		Oh, we fully revamped our mobile browser version too – check it out!
		 `Message us in the app to be an early tester for the iOS app` 👈

-  **December 20th, 2016 - Notion 1.5 ⚡️** 

	#  **Features & Improvements** 

	This is our biggest release since launch. A lot things have changed. We strongly recommend that you [check out our upgrade guide](https://www.notion.so/Notion-1-5-Guide-0e734384e787461483fb4135ff103e97) .

	-  **Enterprise-grade team management 💪 ** 

		As more and more 100+ people companies signed up on Notion, it became obvious that our admin features were lacking.

		With this release, we are giving you tools to mange all of your members, guests, and manage billing from a bird's-eye view. For any teams larger than half a dozen people, you can't live without it!

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/cb5f88592c2344708477823b3ab525f6/Feature_-_Members.gif)

	-  **Custom team domains 👯** 

		Setup a domain like "notion.so/company-name" to access all your team's content or invite new members.

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/6bf7260221934802b8f6afee13dca21d/Feature_-_Custom_Domain.gif)

	-  **A redesigned sidebar + private pages** 

		The sidebar now lets you discover and bookmark other team pages (like joining a Slack channel), or create pages that only invited teammates could access or modify (like Slack private channels).

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/0ff987524a414902b9bf52a3dec533ff/Frame.jpg)

	-  **A more personal Notion 🏠** 

		If you are using Notion by yourself, your Pro features will now cover all of the content you have access to (even if they are created by other people). You don't need to pay for any of your collaborators.

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/d309eeac48a64bca84e560daae93e0f3/Screen_Shot_2016-12-18_at_5.53.10_PM.png)

	-  **Quickly create a new page** 

		Add an empty page quickly, or select from existing templates. It also works with the shortcut `Ctrl/Command + N` 

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/83bb6fcca86d42c2aae43b0dfc19bb62/Feature_-_Create_New_Page.gif)

	-  **New pricing. Unlimited members for everyone!** 

		If you really think about it, our old pricing model really didn't make sense (a collaboration tool that caps on the number of team members, what? 😅)

		So we now removed the 5-member limit completely. Instead, we're introducing a monthly limit on the number of content blocks you can add per month (very hard to hit if you just use Notion normally). You can easily increase your limit by inviting or collaborating with others.

		We also changed the price per user from $5 to $8. If you were previously on a Pro plan, we'll honor your old price of $5 (and thank you for being an early adopter! 😇)

		For more details, please see the [pricing page](https://notion.so/pricing) .

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/70ba89e40022415cadca99b6bf02a806/Screen_Shot_2016-12-15_at_6.37.44_PM.png)

	-  **Simplified editor** 

		We unified "drag", "..." and "+" into a single button. Easier to access. Less in your face.

	-  **Full page path in @mention and search** 

		Now when you search or mention a page, we show the full page path, less confusing for pages that have similar titles.

		![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/notion-static/c1304311f1e8410f95ccc595d0e00d84/Screen_Shot_2016-12-18_at_2.15.05_PM.png)

	-  **Better font for Mac and Windows** 

		Typography nerds might have noticed this already. Notion now uses the default system fonts as the sans-serif option (San Francisco on Mac, Segoe on Windows). Better support for European languages, and emojis! 🍰🍕🌮

	#  **Bug Fixes** 

	-  **Confirming new page title** 

		Before, if you clicked on the background while naming a new page, it would clear your page title.

	-  **Safari PDF Export** 

		Before, the PDF could have extra wide margins.

	-  **Backspace + Undo** 

		Before, sometimes backpack + undo will delete other content on your page.

	-  **/slash command in discussion** 

		Before, /slash command couldn't add new blocks in discussion.

	-  **... and tons of little bugs here and there 🙄** 

---

-  **November 10th, 2016** 

	#  **Bug Fixes** 

	-  **Embed popup.** 

		Previously, the embed popup accept button was cut off 🔪

	-  **Print/PDF styles.** 

		We fixed an issue where printing a Notion page didn't work properly if a sidebar was open. 🙄

	-  **Mac app syncing.** 

		We fixed a bug where sometimes un-synced changes were lost if the app was quit while syncing.

		We made some big changes to our editor! Our goal was to make it feel more like a familiar text editor, without sacrificing our awesome drag and drop magic.

		-  **A better way to rearrange. ✋** 

			When you hover over a block, a small, unobtrusive indicator appears, making it easy to drag anything. You can still drag directly on objects like images and pages.

	#  **Features & Improvements**

		Go to your left sidebar, click "+ Add a Space" and you will see them!

		- If you are part of a team, we encourage you to add a "Team Home", and drag all existing pages **from your left sidebar** there. That way, everything will be discoverable by your teammates.

		(Building a good editor is tricky. We would love to hear your feedback on this change! 👂)

	-  **A sidebar designed for your knowledge base.** 

		The sidebar now shows you the sections inside of a page, making it easy to quickly scan and find the content you need. It will also remember the open/close state for pages at the top level.
